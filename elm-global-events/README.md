# Global Events

This library provides custom event listeners for events that are typically
raised on `document` or `window`, thus enabling HTML elements to listen to
those events.

This library requires that `elm-global-events.js` is included before `elm.js`.

## Disclaimer

**DO NOT use this library!** You should use *subscriptions* or *ports* instead!
